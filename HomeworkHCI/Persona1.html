					<h5>Main Points</h5>
					<p>This person was chosen because she is in daily contact with images, this being the target of the application, she has a great experience in this field and can be a potential user of the application. In addition, the application can make her work easier both personally and professionally. For example:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Experience with certain products(images);</li>
						<li>Working environment;</li>
						<li>Social connections;</li>
						<li>The user's goals.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="leftGroup">
					<h5>Goals</h5>
					<p>The user's goals are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Practical Goals: To identify certain objects in the pictures that are not very clear in order to make the work easier, to do it faster and more efficiently.</li>
						<li>Personal Goals: To save time to do as much as she can, to avoid frustration due to misinterpretations</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="leftGroup">
					<h5>Frustrations and Pain Points</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>UI simplistic;</li>
						<li>The theoretical information on the site is useless, it is not necessary to use the application;</li>
						<li>Sometimes she is not sure which of the 3 identification options is better, so she always uses one and never the other two, even if the information on the site explains.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div itemprop="description" class="detailsRight">
				<h5>Detailed Description</h5>
				<p>This person is secondary because the application finds immediate uses in the field in which they work. Being a student at that faculty, she often works with images, so she has a fairly high level of experience with them and will see the usefulness of the application immediately. In its case, the greatest utility is when it wants to restore certain defective images to be as high quality as possible, so the application indicating the object in the image can save a lot of time and make things easier. In addition to saving time by automating the process of recognizing image content, it will also avoid stressful situations. This field makes her have experience with other tools so she did not encounter any weight during the use of the application. Its only problem with the application being on the UI side does not prevent it from continuing to use it, although the technical part of the information is somewhat extra for it. In conclusion, her experience has been positive and she can be a frequent user of the application (website).</p>

			<h5>Scenarios</h5>
			<p>The application can be used by this person for example if he has an image that is not very clear and wants to improve it so that it is as easy to understand what is in it. It can enter it in the application, receive the answer and on its basis start the recovery process. </p>

					<h5>Main Points</h5>
					<p>This person was chosen because we want to see how someone with a low level of knowledge in using the sites interacts with the application. Finding the usefulness of the application to make it easier to understand the content of the pictures.</strong></p>
				</div>
				<div class="leftGroup">
					<h5>Goals</h5>
					<p>The user's goals are: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Personal Goals: To understand the content of some pictures, to save time being much easier than physical effort.</li>

					<h5>Frustrations and Pain Points</h5>
					<p>Some of the difficulties the user has with the product.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>He did not understand the purpose of three methods of recognizing pictures;</li>
						<li>He does not understand the content of technical information;</li>
                        <li>He did have some trouble starting the program first time;</li>
						<li>Too much information just to understand the content of the picture.</li>

			<div itemprop="description" class="detailsRight">
				<h5>Detailed Description</h5>
				<p>This person being an elderly person is not one of those to whom the application would be destined, but who finds its utility. He has the most basic knowledge of using the internet and websites but had a small problem using the recognition program for the first time, but he succeeded relatively quickly. The minimalist UI helped him better understand the structure of the site. Identifying images with the help of software makes the person save time, it is easier because it no longer involves physical effort to recognize what is in the picture making life easier for the user.</p>

					<h5>Main Points</h5>
					<p>This person was chosen because of the field in which he works. Because he has extensive technical knowledge he can make a correct analysis of everything that happens inside the site. The usefulness of the site is given by the project of which it is part and can make its work easier and more efficient. For example:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Experience with certain products;</li>
						<li>Working environment;</li>
						<li>Social connections;</li>
						<li>The user's goals.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="leftGroup">
					<h5>Goals</h5>
					<p>The user's goals are: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Personal Goals: The personal objectives would be if he wants to discover a new area of computer science, that of machine learning, how everything works in the background, the fields in which he can apply them and the uses in everyday life, all having a personal development of the programmer.</li>
						<li>Business Goals: In the work, it could use the platform as an environment in the case of projects that work on the basis of images to save time, being a cheaper resource.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="leftGroup">
					<h5>Frustrations and Pain Points</h5>
					<p>Some of the difficulties the user has with the product.</p>
					<ul>
                        <li>A more complex or diversified UI for the front end;</li>
                        <li>No open source code;</li>
						<li>Lack of a method of loading a data set already structured on features to get results.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div itemprop="description" class="detailsRight">
				<h5>Detailed Description</h5>
				<p>This is a primary user because his needs can be met by the site. It has both an academic role to develop its knowledge in a new field and in the work so that it can be involved in one of the needs of a project. The user with advanced programming knowledge had an ease in using the site, the documentation was not difficult to understand and could easily interpret the results. The lack of a complex UI is negligible so that the platform does its job and is easy to use. Failure to load a pre-set data set may make the site less useful, and the lack of source code for algorithms would be useful to other users. However, in order to increase their knowledge in the field of informatics, the site does its job as a useful way to learn on its own.</p>
